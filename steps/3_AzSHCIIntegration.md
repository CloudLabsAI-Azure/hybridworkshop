Exercise 1: Integrate Azure Stack HCI 20H2 with Azure
==============
Overview
-----------

As part of the lab environment, we have already deployed the Azure Stack HCI 20H2 Cluster, so you don't have to deploy it and you can continue registering the already deployed cluster to unlock full functionality.

Azure Stack HCI 20H2 is delivered as an Azure service and needs to register within 30 days of installation per the Azure Online Services Terms.  With our cluster configured, we'll now register your Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster with **Azure Arc** for monitoring, support, billing, and hybrid services. Upon registration, an Azure Resource Manager resource is created to represent each on-premises Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster, effectively extending the Azure management plane to Azure Stack HCI 20H2. Information is periodically synced between the Azure resource and the on-premises cluster.  One great aspect of Azure Stack HCI 20H2, is that the Azure Arc registration is a native capability of Azure Stack HCI 20H2, so there is no agent required.


## Task 1: Register Azure Stack HCI 20H2 Cluster on Azure portal.

   To complete registration, you have 2 options - you can use **Windows Admin Center**, or you can use **PowerShell**. For this lab, it's recommended to use the PowerShell as it is less likely that you will encounter unpredictible erros in the lab environment, due to WAC installed on the domain controller. In this environment, we will be using PowerShell to register to the Azure Stack HCI cluster.

 We're going to perform the registration from the **HybridHost001** machine, which we've been using with the Windows Admin Center.

1. On **HybridHost001** VM after you have already logged in, click on the windows button and look for **PowerShell ISE** and right-click on it to **Run as administrator**.

2. With the Az.StackHCI modules installed, it's now time to register your Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster to Azure. However, first it's worth exploring how to check the existing registration status. The following code assumes you are still in the remote PowerShell session open from the previous commands.

     ```powershell
     Invoke-Command -ComputerName AZSHCINODE01 -ScriptBlock {
     Get-AzureStackHCI
     } 
     ```
     
    ![Check the registration status of the Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster](/media/output.png "Check the registration status of the Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster")

As you can see from the result, the cluster is yet to be registered, and the cluster status identifies as **Clustered**. Azure Stack HCI 20H2 needs to register within 30 days of installation as per the Azure Online Services Terms. If it is not clustered within 30 days, the **ClusterStatus** will show **OutOfPolicy**, and if not registered within 30 days, the **RegistrationStatus** will show as **OutOfPolicy**.


3. Now copy the below code and paste it in your PowerShell window, replace *your-subscription-ID-here* with your subscription ID <inject key="Subscription ID" />. After updating the subscription ID, run the PowerShell commands to register your Azure Stack HCI 20H2 to Azure portal. 

   > **Note**: We have already updated the domain user name and password for the local host server. 
   
    ```powershell
     $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "demo!pass123" -AsPlainText -Force
     $azshciNodeCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("hybrid\azureuser", $password)

     Register-AzStackHCI `
    -SubscriptionId "ad8c83dd-1c13-4b87-9acc-a24520706f46" `
    -ResourceName "azshciclus" `
    -ResourceGroupName "HybridHost" `
    -Region "EastUS" `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureCloud" `
    -ComputerName "AZSHCINODE01.hybrid.local" `
    â€“Credential $azshciNodeCreds `
     
     ```

Of these commands, many are optional:

* **-ResourceName** - If not declared, the Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster name is used
* **-ResourceGroupName** - If not declared, the Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster plus the suffix "-rg" is used
* **-Region** - If not declared, "EastUS" will be used.  Additional regions are supported, with the longer term goal to integrate with Azure Arc in all Azure regions.
* **-EnvironmentName** - If not declared, "AzureCloud" will be used, but allowed values will include additional environments in the future
* **-ComputerName** - This is used when running the commands remotely against a cluster.  Just make sure you're using a domain account that has admin privilege on the nodes and cluster
* **-Credential** - This is also used for running the commands remotely against a cluster.

**Register-AzureStackHCI** runs synchronously, with progress reporting, and typically takes 1-2 minutes.  The first time you run it, it may take slightly longer, because it needs to install some dependencies, including additional Azure PowerShell modules.

4. Once dependencies have been installed, you'll receive a popup on **HybridHost001** to authenticate to Azure. Provide your **Azure credentials**.

    ![Login to Azure](/media/azure_login_reg.png "Login to Azure")

5. Once successfully authenticated, the registration process will begin and will take some time to finish. Once completed, you should see a message indicating success, as per below:

    ![Register Azure Stack HCI 20H2 with PowerShell](/media/registered.png "Register Azure Stack HCI 20H2 with PowerShell")

6. Once the cluster is registered, run the following command on **HybridHost001** to check the updated status:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName AZSHCINODE01 -ScriptBlock {
    Get-AzureStackHCI
    }
    ```
    ![Check updated registration status with PowerShell](/media/connected.png "Check updated registration status with PowerShell")

You can see the **ConnectionStatus** and **LastConnected** time, which is usually within the last day unless the cluster is temporarily disconnected from the Internet. An Azure Stack HCI 20H2 cluster can operate fully offline for up to 30 consecutive days.

## Task 2: View registration details in the Azure portal ###

Once the registration is complete, you should take some time to explore the artifacts that are created in Azure.

1. On **HybridHost001**, open the Edge browser and **log into https://portal.azure.com** to check the resources created there. In the **search box** at the top of the screen, search for **Resource groups** and then click on **Resource groups**

1. You should see a new **Resource group** listed, with the name you specified earlier, which in our case, is **HybridHost**

    ![Registration resource group in Azure](/media/rg.png "Registration resource group in Azure")

1. Click on the **HybridHost** resource group, and in the central pane, you'll see that a record with the name **azshciclus** has been created inside the resource group.

    ![Registration resource group in Azure](/media/stack.png "Registration resource group in Azure")

1. Click on the **azihciclus** record, and you'll be taken to the new Azure Stack HCI Resource Provider, which shows information about all of your clusters, including details on the currently selected cluster.
